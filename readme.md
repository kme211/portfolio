# Portfolio site

This is my future portfolio's code.

It's made with:

- React (I know it's necessary but React is fun)
- Moment (for displaying user-friendly dates)
- Webpack (for bundling)
- Babel (for transpiling ES6)
- PostCSS (for autoprefixing)
  - PreCSS (for Sass-like markup in CSS)
- ESLint (for catching those pesky mistakes)
